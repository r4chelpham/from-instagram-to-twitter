# from-instagram-to-twitter
A program to take posts from Instagram and post them onto Twitter. 

- It contains a function which essentially takes in parameters of the username and password of an account, then it downloads the most recent posts of the accounts that it follows. 
- Then it returns a list of the data of each post, which are lists containing the caption and another list of the file names of all the media it contains.
- It then posts these onto Twitter one post at a time. 

This was made to automate the posting process for the Twitter account of the society that I am part of, as Instagram is their main social media. 

The initial commit has a lot of bugs such as:

- Not being able to post videos
- Can only download posts that are posted at the current date (instead of just the most recent post)

This is my first ever program that isn't just a random number generator so any feedback would be much appreciated!
